# M-TriX: Dynamic Balance Architecture
Official implementation of **M-TriX**, a hybrid-causal CNN architecture designed to achieve:
- Dynamic balance between identity and representation paths  
- Strong stability under noise  
- Collapse-resistant behavior  
- Transparent spatial decision fields (p-maps)

## 🧪 Reproducibility Code (v0.6.1)
The repository includes the exact code used to generate:
- Noise-Augmented Training results  
- Reinforced Dual Collapse (Sweep Test)  
- Noise Robustness Test (Dense vs M-TriX)  
- Visual p-map proof  

This code is fully deterministic (fixed seeds) and matches the results reported in the paper.
