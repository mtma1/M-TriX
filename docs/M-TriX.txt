M-TriX (v0.6.1) — Reproducibility Notes
Author: Mohammed M. Alanazi
Paper DOI (Zenodo): https://zenodo.org/records/17613192

Code Version: v0.6.1 (Master Proof)

This document provides the exact steps required to reproduce all experimental results reported in the paper:

“M-TriX: A Hybrid-Causal Neural Architecture for Stability, Efficiency, and Interpretability.”

The included code (notebook or .py file) corresponds to the Master Proof (v0.6.1) and implements:

Noise-Augmented Training (v0.6.0 design)

Sweep Test (Reinforced Dual Collapse)

Noise Robustness Test (M-TriX vs Dense)

Visual Proof (Clean Filter Hypothesis)

All results in the paper can be reproduced from this file alone.

1. Environment

The experiments were executed using:

Python ≥ 3.10

TensorFlow ≥ 2.12

NumPy

Matplotlib

GPU recommended (Colab T4 or A100)

Install the required packages:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

2. Running the Experiments

Run the notebook (.ipynb) or the Python script (.py) exactly as provided.
No modifications or additional files are needed.

The script automatically performs:

Downloading the MNIST dataset

Applying 30% random pixel noise

Training M-TriX on noisy data

Evaluating on:

Clean test set

Noisy test set

Forced-p collapse sweep

Generating all figures used in the paper

3. Outputs Produced

The script generates:

A. Training Curves

Training vs validation loss

Training vs validation accuracy

p-mean evolution curve

B. Sweep Test (Dual Collapse)

Accuracy vs forced-p curve

Learned sweet spot

Dense collapse

Blackout collapse

C. Noise Robustness Test

Dense accuracy on noisy data

M-TriX accuracy on noisy data

Stability confirmation

D. Visual Proof

Clean MNIST image

Noisy version

Corresponding p-map visualization

4. Notes

This file serves as the official reproducibility reference for the paper.

No extra hyperparameters or tuning are required.

All overrides (blackout, forced-p, p-map extraction) are implemented inside the script.

Results are deterministic due to fixed random seeds.
